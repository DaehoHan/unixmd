Mixed quantum-classical (MQC) dynamics is general method for explaining the variation of molecule including
electronic state through time propagation. This can be exactly solved by time-dependent Schrodinger equation
for all particles, but this solution requires enormous cost for numerical calculation so it is restricted for
very small system. MQC tried to describe larger system by consider nuclear as classical particle which follows
classical equation of motion.

UNI-xMD mainly targeted on MQC, and whole dynamics implemented in current version of UNI-xMD are subclass of
MQC class. In the MQC class, there are functions for update classical properties of nuclear.
